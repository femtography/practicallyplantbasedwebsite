      <p>“ I’ve been a vegetarian for three years now. When I first switched over I was working full time on Active Duty and I was an amateur fighter so I needed to keep protein up and costs down. There’s a lot of reasons for going plant-based or veg, whether it’s animal rights, environmental concerns, or just better health. I felt all of those things were important to me and wanted to make a bigger change in the world and I started by reducing my carbon footprint by going plantbase. I initially relied on faux meat products, because it’s hard to imagine a world without chicken nuggets. Overtime I just started adding beans, tofu, and extra veggies to every meal and found myself not even missing the meat and still training hard and feeling good. Now I’m in nursing school and I’m busier than ever and on a budget. The goal I am working at is having healthy food that isn’t all homemade. I buy premade sauces, I don’t make my own nut milk, and I live for cooking shortcuts. I want to share a realistic option into meatless meals that will be satisfying, delicious, and won’t be out of budget. “</p>

      <p>“ I’ve been a vegetarian for three years.  My primary motivation for it was because of environmental impact factory farming has, the conditions the animals face, and my overall health. When I first went veggie I was concerned about protein and nutrients because I was a fighter. I quickly learned to add beans, tofu, and extra vegetables to everything and never felt like I was missing out on protein or other essential nutrients.</p>
      <p>This website is a way to make plant-based eating simple. I want to show people that you can eat great food, feel full and satisfied, and spend less on groceries. I hope you take these recipes and create your own favorite meatless dish.</p>
