      <h1>"Eating Healthy Is Expensive..."</h1>
      </div>
      <h3>Whether it’s organic, sustainable, or any other synonym for the healthy versions of food you imagine in a plant-based diet, it almost always is associated with paying more. </h3>
      <p>Going to a specialty “health foods” store is certainly going to up your grocery bill. What we found worked best was sticking to the grocery store’s brand, like Kroger, for the majority of my groceries and going to Trader Joe’s for the specialty items we love and can’t live without. </p>
      <p>The best part of a plant-based diet is that all of our favorite protein items, such as beans and tofu, are incredibly affordable compared to the price of meat. Reducing your animal products will reduce the cost of your groceries, and you can be certain that we took that into account when making your recipes.</p>

      <h1>Jaim Benson</h1>
      <p>“ There’s a lot of reasons for going plant-based, whether it’s animal rights, environmental concerns, or just better health. I’ve been a vegetarian for three years now and, initially, my motivation for going plant-based was the conditions that animals face. It was not long before I realized that all of three of those reasons were important to me and I wanted to make a bigger change in the world, so I started improving all of those areas at once by going plant-based.</p>
      <p>When I went plant-based, I was working full time on Active Duty and I was an amateur fighter, so I needed to keep my protein and nutrients up and my costs down. In all honesty, I relied heavily on faux meat products initially, because it’s hard to imagine a world where I can’t have chicken nuggets. I quickly learned to add beans, tofu, and extra vegetables to everything to make my meals more satisfying. Over time I found myself not even missing the meat and I never felt like I was missing out on protein or other essential nutrients, even when living an active lifestyle. Now, I’m in nursing school, so I’m busier than ever and my budget is as tight as ever. I live for cooking shortcuts and the idea of making delicious and healthy food without making everything from scratch. Who has the time..?</p>
      <p>This website is a resource that provides you with a realistic option for plant-based meals that will be delicious, satisfying, and won’t be out of budget. I hope you take these recipes and create your own favorite plant-based dishes.“</p>

      <h1>Jeff Soto</h1>
      <p>“ I officially made the transition to a plant-based diet just before the start of 2020, and I must say that I could not have done it without the the help of Jaimee. I know that Jaimee always likes to brag about how well I transitioned into the diet, but she completely overlooks how integral her guidance was to my success and ultimately staying on track.</p>
      <p>To be completely transparent, I really only consumed chicken before going plant-based, with the occasional rare steak for special occasions. The main reason that I could not bring myself to commit to a plant-based diet was not knowing how to replace the meat in my diet, both substantially as well as nutritionally. So whenever Jaimee came into my life with recipes that could do exactly that, I allowed myself to make that transition and have yet to look back!</p>
      <p>I wanted to create a resource like Jaimee was for me, but a resource that anybody would be able to lean on in their transition to a plant-based diet. I hope that this website is able to accomplish exactly that. Please reach out with any feedback you have, good or bad, we would love to adapt this website to help our plant-based family as best as possible. “</p>
